# Student-Echo PromptFlow Pipeline

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for the **Student-Echo PromptFlow Project**, an advanced pipeline leveraging **Azure AI** to enable seamless integration of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and survey data analysis. The pipeline is designed to process **survey response data** using **state-of-the-art LLMs** such as **GPT-4.0** and **Llama3**, and integrates with **MySQL databases** for efficient data management.

### Key Features

1. **Data Retrieval**: Connects to a **MySQL database** to retrieve raw survey response data efficiently.
2. **LLM Integration**: Leverages cutting-edge **LLMs (GPT-4.0 and Llama3)** for sentiment analysis, natural language understanding, and advanced text processing.
3. **Result Storage**: Outputs processed data and stores results back into the **MySQL database**, ensuring a complete **end-to-end data pipeline**.
4. **Azure AI PromptFlow**: Utilizes the **Azure AI PromptFlow Platform** for orchestrating prompts, managing workflows, and optimizing LLM-based analyses.

## Repository Structure

- **`src/`**: Source code for connecting to MySQL, LLMs, and orchestrating prompt flows.
- **`config/`**: Configuration files for database connection, LLM settings, and Azure PromptFlow integration.
- **`templates/`**: Jinja2 templates for prompt engineering and dynamic text generation.
- **`results/`**: Processed outputs and analyses stored in structured formats.

## Key Technologies and Tools

- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: GPT-4.0, Llama3.
- **Azure AI PromptFlow**: For workflow orchestration and prompt engineering.
- **Python**: Core programming language for data engineering, LLM interaction, and database operations.
- **MySQL**: Relational database for storing and retrieving survey response data.
- **Jinja2**: For dynamic prompt engineering and template-based text generation.
- **ETL Pipelines**: End-to-end workflows for data extraction, transformation, and loading.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.9+**
- **Azure AI Account** with PromptFlow enabled.
- **MySQL Server
